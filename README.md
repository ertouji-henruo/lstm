# Alice in Wonderland Neural Network

## Overview

The **Alice in Wonderland Neural Network** is a specialized machine learning model trained on the text of Lewis Carroll's classic novel, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." This neural network is designed to generate text, mimic the writing style, and explore themes present in the original work. This README provides an overview of the project, its functionality, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Description

- **Goal**: The primary objective of this project is to create a neural network capable of generating creative text that mirrors the whimsical and fantastical elements found in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."
- **Dataset**: The model is trained on the complete text of the novel, utilizing its rich vocabulary and unique narrative style to inform the neural network's language generation capabilities.

## Model Architecture

The Alice in Wonderland Neural Network employs a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** architecture, specifically utilizing **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** cells to capture long-range dependencies in the text.

- **Input Layer**: Processes the tokenized input text.
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens into dense vector representations to capture semantic meanings.
- **LSTM Layers**: Multiple stacked LSTM layers to learn sequential patterns and dependencies.
- **Output Layer**: Generates predictions for the next word based on the input sequence.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies and set up the environment for running the Alice in Wonderland Neural Network, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Navigate to your preferred directory and clone the repository.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended): 
   - Create a virtual environment for the project.

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - Use the requirements.txt file to install the necessary libraries.

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**: To train the model on the text of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," run the training script.

2. **Generate Text**: Once the model is trained, you can generate text by executing the generation script. Adjust parameters to specify the desired output length.

3. **Evaluate the Model**: To evaluate the model's performance on specific prompts, use the evaluation script with your chosen prompt.

## Examples

Here are a few example prompts and generated outputs:

1. **Prompt**: "Alice found herself in a curious place"  
   **Generated Output**: "where the flowers talked amongst themselves, and the trees danced merrily in the breeze."

2. **Prompt**: "The Cheshire Cat smiled"  
   **Generated Output**: "with a grin that seemed to stretch across the sky, leaving behind a trail of sparkling laughter."
